About me
======
I began my degree at UBC in 2022 where I initially studied Chemical and Biological Engineering. Working as the Instrumentation Lead for [Biological Internet of Things](https://ubcbiot.com/) (UBC BIoT), I made the switch to study Computer Engineering.

I am now the current Captain for UBC BIoT, where we create open-source IoT devices to automate and collect data for small-scale breweries while researching innovative biological projects such as glow-in-the-dark beer, or using ultrasonication to speed up fermentation. My work involves consulting the team on project execution, providing the team with project/career opportunities, and communicating with stakeholders and sponsors to acquire funding.
